00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.340
Welcome to the demo video of our Visualization. So
when the user first opens up our website,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.380
they will see the title a Holistic Look at
the College Lifecycle, along with the motivation

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.710
and use case the background. And finally, they
will come to the Visualization. So the first

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.550
visualization they will see is this map of
the United States, where the user will be

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.750
able to hover over individual states and see
those states statistics for tuition costs,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.260
salary prospects. So you see here Massachusetts
average out of state tuition costs, average

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.970
in state tuition costs, average early career
pay, and average mid career pay. As the user

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.030
scrolls down further, they will reach the
college Compare functionality.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.620
Here they will be able to select two different
colleges and compare statistics. So let's see

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:59.020
Northeastern University
compared to let's go with Alaska Pacific University. So

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.260
two very different colleges.The user will
then hit the Compare button.The first thing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.000
they'll see pop up is a pie chart with the
diversity statistics of that particular university. So

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.130
they can hover over this pie chart and see
the exact percentages of students of these

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.100
races that are admitted. And the pie chart
will also change opacity and border width

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.790
so that the user can see exactly which slice
they're highlighting. As they scroll further

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.650
down, they'll come across two bar charts, one
for each college where we have the specific

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.180
in state tuition cost, out of state tuition
cost, early career pay, and mid career pay

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.939
for that college. And as the user hovers over
these bars, they will see the exact amounts

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.930
on the tooltip below, and they will also see
the respective bar on the other chart be highlighted

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.810
as well. You can see that for all the bars
on both graphs. Now, if the student is tired

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.781
of comparing Alaska Pacific University to
Northeast University, they can also come and

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.700
compare with another college, let's say Auburn
University.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.440
Hit Compare and the graphs will update with
Auburn's data.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.960
Thank you.
